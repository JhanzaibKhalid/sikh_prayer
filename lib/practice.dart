  "Waking up early at Amrit Vela is very important for Sikhs. Its when the whole world is sleeping. When you wake up early and meditate / pray, you have complete peace. Also it is very hard to do this, so those that try get many rewards from Guru Jee. Guru Jee says, in the early hours of the morning wake up and recite shabads then all day do simran with your breath",
"When we wake in the morning, the first thing we have to do is to clean our outer body. We call this ishnaan. Then we are to sit and meditate to clean our inner self, the soul and mind. Guru says, if you do this, the mind and the body will not suffer from diseases and if there are any challenges in our way, Guru will remove them for us. Guru Jee loves us, and wants to help us always.",
  "Bhagat Kabir was a deeply religious muslim  saint. He recognised that there is one God who had many names. He recognised the universal path of love and brotherhood. His hymns were included into the Sikh holy scriptures. In this hymn (shabad) Bhagat Jee is referencing all the places that God lives. He talks about our hair and how even within the tiniest of hairs, God is there. That's why it is important to not cut, dye, pluck, burn or harm our hair. We call our hair Kesh and love them with our heart.",
"Guru Arjun Dev Jee is talking to us about being thankful for what we have (even if it's just simple bread to eat). Whatever Guru Jee gives us, we should be happy to recieve it and remember those less fortunate than us (those that have nothing to eat). Read this shabad before and after you eat or recieve something. You can also recite it when you want something that you do not get. This will help you to be thankful for what you have."
